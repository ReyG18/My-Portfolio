# My Portfolio

## Description

This is a rough draft of my portfolio. I found this to be incredibly challenging, therefore
it is incomplete. I will continue to work on this regularly because I am determined to learn
CSS; clearly it's not one of my strong suits...

## Challenges

I ran into many issues and challenges while trying to style this portfolio. Flexbox options
were inconsistent for me. For example, justify-content and align-items/content would yield
no results on some sections, while having no issues on others. As a result, I feel that I was
forced to abuse margin and padding in order to properly position certain elements.

I was not able to figure out how to stylize the work boxes at all. I tried experimenting with grid, but I could not get any options to yield results of any kind. 

Ultimately, I ran out of time and was not able to add any hovering effects or proper background images...

I did my best but I will continue to work on this.
